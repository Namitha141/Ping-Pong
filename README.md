# Ping-Pong
The Ping Pong game is a fun game to play when bored. To play,  there will be two paddles on your screen, One on the right hand side and the other on the left hand. You can use the arrow keys to move the paddles up and down to keep the ball in the game and not float away. You can play with a friend and see who wins!
